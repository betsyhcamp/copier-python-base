TODO — one sentence on what this project does.


A minimal, production-grade Python project scaffold.

This project was generated from a Copier template designed to standardize:
- Python packaging and project structure
- Local development and CI workflows
- Linting, formatting, and testing conventions

The goal is to provide a **reliable foundation** that scales from local development to CI without surprises.

---

## Requirements

- Python {{ python_version }}
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/)

Make sure these three tools are installed.

## Getting started

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

Pre-commit hooks can be installed with:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Project structure

The template project structure which optionally includes a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is as follows: 

```text
.
├── .github
│   └── workflows
│       └── ci.yml
├── .gitignore
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml
├── .python-version
├── .vscode
│   └── settings.example.json
├── uv.lock
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── src
│   └── {{ package_name }}
│       └── __init__.py
├── Taskfile.yml
└── tests
    ├── conftest.py
    └── test_smoke.py
```

* `src/` layout is used for correct packaging behavior
* Tooling configuration lives in `pyproject.toml`
* Automation is centralized in `Taskfile.yml`

## Development workflow

Common tasks:
```bash
task install       # Run uv sync
task lint          # Run linters
task lint-fix      # Run linters with automated fixes 
task format        # Auto-format code
task test          # Run tests
task ci            # Run full CI suite
task all-precommit # Run precommit hooks on all files
```

## Notes
* Tool versions are intentionally pinned where appropriate for reproducibility.
* CI (if enabled) mirrors local commands exactly via the Taskfile.
* This repository is intended to be adapted to your specific domain needs.
* Dependencies are handled by `uv` and `uv.lock` is where all dependencies are documented. As a result, `uv.lock` should be committed.
* For VSCode users, copy `.vscode/settings.example.json` to `.vscode/settings.json`
